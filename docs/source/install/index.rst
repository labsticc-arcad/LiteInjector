==================

In this section we're going to detail the complete installation of LiteX and the emulator. In addition, we provide a test program to start using the emulator and check that it is working properly. Finally, we present the different ways of controlling the emulator, how to connect the FPGA board to the host machine and how to use LiteX Server to establish connections with the board.
