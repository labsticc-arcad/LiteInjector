[> Example PMP configure
----------------------

This firmware tests the configuration of a read-only PMP.

[> Build and Load over LiteX-Term
---------------------------------

To build a LiteX SoC for the Arty board (available in LiteX-Boards) and build the demo app for it, execute the following commands:

Since our app is small and for simplicity we'll just load it over serial here:
 `$ litex_term /dev/ttyUSBX --kernel=enter-the-path/exampe-pmp.bin`

You should see the minimal demo app running and should be able to interact with it:
